# Functions & Unit Testing

Learn to trace functions, and to check a function's behavior with unit tests.

## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **Defining vs. Calling**: You can explain the difference between _defining_
  and _calling_ a function , and you can find both in a program.
- 🥚 **Tracing Functions**: You can trace a program that uses programs using
  trace tables and a step debugger.
- 🥚 **Arguments, Parameters, Return Values**: While tracing a function call you
  can explain the difference between an _argument_, a _parameter_ and a _return
  value_.
- 🐣 **Reading Documentation**: You can read a JS Doc comment to understand what
  a function should do.
- 🐣 **Writing Documentation**: You can write a JS Doc comment to describe a
  working function.
- 🐥 **Reading Unit Tests**: You can read unit tests and their output to
  understand what a function is supposed to do.
- 🐥 **Passing Unit Tests**: You can use unit test output to help you write a
  passing function.
