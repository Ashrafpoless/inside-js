# Sabotage

A fun lesson. You'll form groups of 3 and study different coding challenges:

- __10__ mins: In your groups, pick a coding challenge you want to study.
  - Write tests for it
  - Pass the tests (in more than one way if you have time)
- __10__ mins: Trade functions + tests with another group
  - study their tests and solution(s)
  - add 2 mistakes to their function
  - add 2 mistakes to their tests
- __10__ mins: Trade with a _different_ group so you need to fix a function you
  didn't write.
  - find the mistakes
  - fix the mistakes
  - prepare a short retro to present with the class
- __10__ mins: Each group presents the code they fixed:
  - what went well
  - what went less well
  - lessons learned
